If the oni wins the roll however, it is free of control and typically runs amok until it is destroyed. Naming an oni is a perilous business, for the oni will try to steal the name away and thereby gain full autonomy and the ability to remain in the mortal realm. Such creatures become Oni Lords, monstrously powerful, able to spawn lesser but still potent copies of themselves. Thus summoned oni will typically not immediately attack the persons who gave them names, seeking instead to leave them alive until they can steal the names completely. Any person who shares their name with an oni will acquire an Oni Mark, a small discoloration on the skin. Every day the bearer of an Oni Mark must make an Earth roll to resist gaining the Shadowlands taint as the connection to the oni corrupts them {see the Taint rules for more details}. Each week they must make another Contested Willpower Roll, similar to the first, against the oni in order to avoid surrendering their name to it. The oni gains +1k1 to this roll for each Rank of Shadowlands Taint the Mark has inflicted on its bearer. If the name-bearer is the same person who summoned the oni, he continues to gain the +3k2 bonus to the roll, plus any bonuses from Raises on the original spell. If the oni ever wins this roll it steals the victim's name and becomes an Oni Lord, freeing itself from any control by its summoner (even if that person is different from the one with the Oni Mark). The now-nameless victim of the Oni Mark becomes a slave of the oni and must obey its commands. If the oni is destroyed or otherwise banished back to Jigoku, it loses its connection to the person with its name and the Oni Mark disappears.","keywords":[],"raises":["Special (+1k0 per Raise to the Willpower roll to control the oni)","Special (more powerful oni, GM's discretion)"],"origin":{"id":"core","name":"Core Rulebook"},"tags":["maho"]},{"name":"[MAHO] Armour Of Obsidian","area":"One target person or creature (can be caster)","mastery":"3","element":"fire","range":"Touch","duration":"10 minutes or until used","id":"maho_armour_of_obsidian","description":"This spell wreaths the target in an invisible shield of kansen.

Much like Musubi, this Kiho requires the monk to have a staff and maintain it in motion; however, this Kiho requires the monk to expend a Simple Action on the staff’s movement each Round in order to provide a sufficient focus for his chi. While this Kiho is in effect, the monk has the ability to deflect kami with the Water chi which he focuses through the staff. In game terms, when a spell specifically targets the monk (not an area-effect spell), the monk may make a Contested Roll of his Staves/Water against the shugenja’s Spell Casting roll. If the monk wins the roll, his chi disrupts the spell and disperses it, negating its effects against him. (If the spell is targeting multiple people, the other targets are not protected by the Kiho.) The monk may do this a number of times per skirmish equal to his Water Ring. At the GM’s option, this Kiho may also be able to defend against maho spells, using the pure Water chi to disrupt the kansen. However, the monk must make 3 Raises on the Contested Roll in order to succeed.","tags":[],"origin":{"id":"bow","name":"Book of Water"}},{"element":"water","id":"tasaii_do","mastery":"6","name":"Tasaii-Do","type":"martial","description":"This Kiho focuses the monk’s Water chi offensively, channeling it through his staff in order to overwhelm his opponent.
